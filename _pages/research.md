## What is coming up?
Current projects that I am finalising, i.e. **almost there**: 
{: .notice--warning}

- TORCH-VIC: State-wide Victorian linked dataset for cancer research, cohort profile
- PRIMCAT-MEL: Whole disease model for melanoma, using TORCH-VIC & clinical registry data
- PRIMCAT-LUNG: Whole disease model for non-small cell lung cancer, using TORCH-VIC & clinical registry data
- Distance travelled methodology: Comparing different methods of calculating travel distance from residence to place of care using TORCH-VIC 
- Distance travelled for care: Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of cancer treatment, but how much do patients travel around Victoria to receive their care?
- Consumer-led research: Developped a model with consumers to establish a real consumer-led research project: what has (not) worked, how, and what to do next!
