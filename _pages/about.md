## Hello
Welcome to my personal research page. This website is meant to provide some udpates on my research, R tutorials & code, and blog posts.

### About me
I am a senior researcher and senior data scientist specialised in clinical and digital health at the [University of Melbourne](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-policy/research-group/cancer-health-unit). I leverage linked data sources collected in various forms within the healthcare continuum to improve precision medicine for cancer patients and reduce the burden of disease. My goal is to generate actionable clinical insights, inform healthcare policies, and improve cancer care equity.

My broader interests include treatment patterns, inequities in access and provision of care, consumers & researchers partnership, predictive modelling, and health economics. Back in 2018, I earned my PhD in Clinical Medicine, where I explored the role of immunity & tumour microenvironment in colorectal cancer. Today, my research focuses on harnessing population based linked-datasets to improve cancer care and public health.
